In C or C++ Programming Language, it is known that pointers hold the address of the variables or any memory location. 
If pointers are pointed to the memory location, it can be used to change the value of the variable.

As for functions, any pointer can be passed by itself, or by the address of the pointer. 
But If the memory location of the pointer is to be changed permanently out of the function, 
it must be captured with a reference or double-pointer within the function i.e., with the assumption any memory 
is created inside the local function.

Afterward, it is pointed to the pointer captured by the function without any reference or any double-pointer.
 In this situation, there is no change inside the main function because it was not captured by reference or a 
 double-pointer inside the function definition.
