what are heaps?

a special type of binary tree based data structure that has property called heap property

heap property is key concpety in heaps that in max heaps for every node the value of that
node is >= to the values of its children and in min heaps for every node the value of that
node <= to the values of its childrens.

heaps are used for efficent operations like finding minimum or maximum element.

used to implement priority queues and heapsort

there are two types of heaps
    max heaps and min heaps

max heaps: for every node the value of that node is >= to the values of its children

min heaps: for every node the value of that node <= to the values of its childrens.

how to represent a heap? by arrays. each element in array corresponds to a node in binary tree. 

if an element is at index 'i' in array, its left child is at index '2*i + 1' and its right
child is at index '2*i +2'

how to build a heap? with array of values, you can construct a heap from it, which is called
heapifying

heapifying: start from last non leaf node 'usually (n/2)-1, where n is num of elements' and move upwards,
ensuring heap property is satisfied at each step

main op's: insertion, extraction, peeking, heapify

real world uses: scheduling tasks with different priorities, graph algorithms like dijkstra's algo, and heapsort.
