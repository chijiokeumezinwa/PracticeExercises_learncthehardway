A hash table is data structure that allows storage and quick retrieval of values like a dictionary


Key concept is hashing, converting a key into an index where value is stored.

A hash table consists of:
array
hash function


hashing step by step:
    -you have a key ie a word 
    -run key through hash function
    -hash function gives you an index in array
    -store value at that index

collisions occurs when different keys might map to same index due to limited number of slots

We need collision handling strategies.

Two common strategies are: 
Chaining and open addressing

op's of hash table: insertion, search, deletion

hash tables have practical uses such as databases, caches, compilers, spell checkers etc.
provides fast data retrieval making operations efficent even for large datasets.
